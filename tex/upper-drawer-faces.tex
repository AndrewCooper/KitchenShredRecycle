\section{Upper Drawer Faces}
------------------
The faces of the upper 3 drawers are faux panel-frame style. The frame is 3/4 of solid wood. The center panel is also solid wood of a contrasting color. No joinery should be necessary to glue these parts together.

To help hide any imperfections to the glue joints between the contrasting woods, consider a shallow reveal around the edge of the center piece
