\section{Doors}

The bookshelf doors are true panel-frame inset doors. Cut the panels from 1/4'' plywood and grooves in the rails and stiles to fit snugly. Use tongue and groove joinery for the rails and stiles.

The shredder/recycling drawer has a fake panel-frame door as its drawer face. Same construction method as the bookshelf doors with an extra stile in the center for support.
