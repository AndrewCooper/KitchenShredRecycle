\section{Carcass}
Construction of the cabinet carcass begins by preparing the sides with grooves for the shelves and a beveled top corner to keep the mail slot area well lit. Next, we carefully measure and cut the shelves to meet the desired final cabinet width. Finally, we assemble the carcass with glue and clamps.

\subsection{Sides}

\subsubsection{Rough Cut}
Cut the sides as a single connected piece from 3/4'' plywood. The two sides will be separated and 
cut to final size after cutting dadoes for shelves. Rough cut these pieces about 1'' extra wide so
any tear-out while routing the dados will be cleaned up during final dimensioning.

\subsubsection{Dados for Shelves}
Cross cut dadoes into the combined carcass side piece. Do this while the sides are still connected to ensure each groove aligns perfectly with its mate on the other side.

NOTE! Plywood is sold in metric thicknesses so 3/4'' plywood is often thinner than that. Work up to the correct dado size to ensure a tight fit or use a router bit that perfectly matches the thickness of the shelves.

\subsubsection{Separate and Dimension}
Rip the two sides of the carcass apart by cutting down the middle (dashed line in the diagrams). Finally, rip these sides to their final width, cutting off any router tearout on the outer edges.

\subsubsection{Top Bevels}
The top-front corner of the sides needs a bevel to give some visual interest and to allow overhead light into the otherwise dark mail slots. Temporarily laminate the two sides together with double-sided tape

\end{figure}

\subsection{Shelves}
Cut the shelves from 3/4'' plywood. This design can be cut from a single 4'x8' sheet, but a less 
expensive plywood could be used since the shelves primarily do not show.

Glue and clamp the carcass together, ensuring square corners and proper clamping pressure on each 
shelf.
